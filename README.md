# Baseball-Reference-Scraper
This code will scrape Baseball reference (https://www.baseball-reference.com/) for game level data for a team during a given time interval (eg 1960-1975).  Data will be saved into a single CSV which is named appropriately based on the team and year range in the working directory.  The user will input the team abbreviation as a string ```t``` and year range ```n``` to ```m```.  This code was used to generate game-level data for my Wpct Shiny app (https://github.com/matthew-meers/Wpct-App).
